Class Leader Election Smart Contract

The Class Leader Election Smart Contract is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows participants to vote for candidates in a class and determine the class leader based on the votes received.

Features

Multiple candidates can be added for the class leader position.
Participants can cast their votes for their preferred candidate.
The contract automatically tallies the votes and determines the candidate with the highest number of votes as the class leader.
Once the election is concluded, the contract provides the address of the elected class leader.
Usage

Setup
Deploy the ClassLeaderElection contract on a compatible Ethereum blockchain network.
Pass an array of candidate addresses to the contract constructor. Each candidate represents a student running for the class leader position.
Voting
Use the vote function to cast your vote for a specific candidate. Provide the address of the candidate you wish to vote for as the function parameter.
You can only vote once for a candidate.
Make sure to call the vote function before the election ends. Once the endElection function is called, voting is no longer possible.
Ending the Election
To conclude the election, call the endElection function. This function determines the candidate with the highest number of votes and assigns them as the class leader.
After the endElection function is called, no further votes can be cast.
Retrieving the Class Leader
After the election is concluded by calling the endElection function, the contract provides the address of the elected class leader through the classLeader variable.
Development

Prerequisites
Solidity v0.8.0 or later
Compatible Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)
Testing
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Install the required dependencies by running npm install.
Run the test suite using npm test. This will execute the predefined tests to ensure the contract functions as expected.
Security Considerations

Ensure that only trusted candidate addresses are passed to the contract constructor to prevent unauthorized candidates from participating in the election.
Carefully review and audit the contract code for any potential security vulnerabilities before deploying it to the blockchain network.
